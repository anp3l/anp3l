# Hi, I'm Andrea 👋

### Junior Full-Stack Developer

I am a recent Computer Science graduate, currently building my portfolio and sharpening my skills as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. My thesis focused on developing a video content management module for a web platform, and from that work I started an independent project to practice full-stack architecture in a real-world scenario.

- 🎓 Computer Science graduate (L-31), University of Turin.
- 🔭 Currently working on **Remote Video Library**, a personal project inspired by my thesis work.
- 💻 Interested in modern web development, clean architecture, and developer experience.
- 🚀 Open to junior full-stack opportunities and collaborations.

### 📽️ Highlight Project: Remote Video Library

A modern video management platform built with a microservices architecture. The Angular 20 frontend communicates with two independent Node.js/Express backends: an authentication service handling user identity and a video service managing content and HLS streaming.

**Architecture:**
- Microservices design with dedicated Auth and Video services
- Docker containerization with health checks for auto-healing
- MongoDB for both user data and video metadata

**Key Features:**
- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Per-user video libraries with metadata management
- HLS adaptive streaming with Video.js player
- Automated thumbnail generation and video processing
- Material Design + Tailwind CSS UI

**Security:**
- RSA-signed JWT tokens for user authentication across services
- HMAC-signed temporary URLs for video stream access control
- Public/private key infrastructure for service-to-service trust

**🎯 Project Goal**
To explore real-world full-stack patterns including microservices architecture, distributed authentication, secure video streaming, and containerized deployment.

**Repositories:**
- Frontend: [Remote Video Client](https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-client)
- Video Service: [Remote Video Server](https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-server)
- Auth Service: [Remote Auth Server](https://github.com/anp3l/auth-server)
