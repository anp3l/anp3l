# Hi, I'm Andrea 👋

### Junior Full-Stack Developer

I am a recent Computer Science graduate, currently building my portfolio and sharpening my skills as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. My thesis focused on developing a video content management module for a web platform, and from that work I started an independent project to practice full-stack architecture in a real-world scenario.

- 🎓 Computer Science graduate (L-31), University of Turin.
- 🔭 Currently working on **Remote Video Platform**, a microservices-based video streaming system with Docker orchestration.
- 💻 Interested in modern web development, clean architecture, and developer experience.
- 🚀 Open to junior full-stack opportunities and collaborations.

### 📽️ Highlight Project: Remote Video Platform

A complete video streaming system with microservices architecture and Docker 
orchestration. Features dedicated Auth Server (JWT identity provider), Video 
Server (FFmpeg/HLS), and Angular frontend with Material Design.

**🚀 Self-contained:** Deploy the entire stack locally with Docker Compose.

**Architecture:**
- Microservices design with dedicated Auth and Video services
- Docker containerization with health checks and restart policies
- MongoDB for both user data and video metadata

**Key Features:**
- Secure JWT authentication across microservices
- Per-user video libraries with metadata management
- HLS adaptive streaming (1080p/720p/480p/360p)
- Automated FFmpeg transcoding and thumbnail generation
- Material Design + Tailwind CSS UI

**Security:**
- RSA-signed JWT tokens for user authentication across services
- HMAC-signed temporary URLs for video stream access control
- Public/private key infrastructure for service-to-service trust

**🎯 Project Goal**
To explore real-world full-stack patterns including microservices architecture, distributed authentication, secure video streaming, and containerized deployment.

**🔗 Main Repository:**  
**[Remote Video Platform](https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-platform)** – Complete system with Docker orchestration, architecture documentation, and deployment guide.

**📦 Individual Services:**
- [Auth Server](https://github.com/anp3l/auth-server) – RS256 JWT identity provider
- [Video Server](https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-server) – FFmpeg transcoding & HLS streaming
- [Frontend Client](https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-client) – Angular 20 UI with Video.js player
