# Hi, I'm Andrea 👋

### Junior Full-Stack Developer

I am a recent Computer Science graduate, currently building my portfolio and sharpening my skills as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. My thesis focused on developing a video content management module for a web platform, and from that work I started an independent project to practice full-stack architecture in a real-world scenario.

- 🎓 Computer Science graduate (L-31), University of Turin.
- 🔭 Currently working on **Remote Video Library**, a personal project inspired by my thesis work.
- 💻 Interested in modern web development, clean architecture, and developer experience.
- 🚀 Open to junior full-stack opportunities and collaborations.
